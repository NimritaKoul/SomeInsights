I am Nimrita Koul, an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning and Data Science. I live in Bangalore, India.
I am a [Kashmiri Pandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_of_Kashmiri_Hindus) and a strong believer in Ancient Indian Wisdom of [Advait Vedanta](https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/). [Shri Ramana Maharshi](https://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/) of Tiruannamalai, India, is my spiritual perceptor.

Here are links to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=lD_Ce2gAAAAJ&hl=en), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nimritakoul/) and [Vidhwan](https://vidwan.inflibnet.ac.in/profile/115748) profiles. Here is my [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/stats/day/nimritakoulblog.wordpress.com) Blog. I update it less often.

I am interested in continuous learning and am open to joint research work in the domain of Machine Learning. 

I am an investigator for two research projects funded by Department of Science and Technology, Government of India. These funds have helped establish the Center of Excellence in Cognitive Technologies and Cyber Security at REVA University. The center has two research labs funded by DST, GoI. At present, we are working on 2 DST funded research projects as well as Deep Learning Projects for Healthcare applications under Nvidia Jetson Nano 2GB Grant Program.
