Welcome to my Github Page. Here, I will post my musings into Self, Science and Surroundings.

I am Nimrita Koul, an Assistant Professor in Machine Learning and Data Science. I live in Bangalore, India.
I am a [Kashmiri Pandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_of_Kashmiri_Hindus) and a strong believer in Ancient Indian Wisdom of [Advait Vedanta](https://www.advaita-vedanta.org/avhp/). [Shri Ramana Maharshi](https://www.sriramanamaharshi.org/) of Tiruannamalai, India is my spiritual perceptor.
